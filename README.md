# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This project is a Code Refactor for Horiseon's website. The purpose of this project was to use semantic elements to make the HTML codebase more accessible without changing what the code actually does. In doing this, I was able to simplify the CSS stylesheet to make it easier for any developer to make changes to the layout of the webpage. I also repaired a link that was not functioning properly. In completing this project, I learned how the use of class elements in the HTML codebase can allow a developer to use a simpler CSS stylesheet and makes the code more accessible for all developers to modify the codebase as desired. 

## Usage

To use this project, you will just need to load the site into your web browser.
